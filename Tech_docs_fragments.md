**Accounting Details**  
In this section, you can allocate costs across different cost objects and apply them to the entire purchase order. By default, the system prioritizes accounting details for the entire purchase order (if available). To override this and prioritize accounting details for individual items, set the configuration attribute jcataxxostObjects (boolean) to true (default is false).

**Attachments**  
Attachments
You can attach documents to the purchase order by either dragging and dropping files or clicking the area labeled 'Drop xls, xlsx, doc, docx, pdf files here' to browse and upload the required files.

- To make an attachment visible to the supplier, select the Available for Suppliers checkbox below the file name.
- To delete an attachment, click the bin icon next to the file name.  

Note: If you attach a file but do not select the Available for Suppliers checkbox, the attachment is treated as an internal note. It will not impact the purchase order, and no changes will occur when you release the edited purchase order.
